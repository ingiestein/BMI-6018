# Complex data types

## Collection Data Types

- tuple

```python
(n,m,j)
```

- list

```python
[n,m,j]
```

- set

```python
{n,m,j}
```

- dict

```python
{var:val,var2:val2}

```

## Mutability

Ability to change content of a data type.

tuples are immutable.

### slicing

```python
mylist = [1,2,3,4]
sliceing = mylist[1:4]
```

Slicing start value is inclusive.
Slicing end value is exclusive.

### Tuples

#### Methods

```python
my_tuple.index[40] # shows you the value at an index
len(my_tuple) # shows length

```

Adding tuples appends the second to the end of the first.
